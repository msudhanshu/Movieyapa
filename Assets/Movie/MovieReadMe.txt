// effect
// effect decided at random, but a question table may contain included and exluded effect if any
// effect table will be a constant market data seperatly
// effect table will have min max limit of effect's parameter
// and depending on the current level toughness, randomally choosen effect's parameter value will be picked
// sound viz will have many prefab with diff viz effect

question can be of image/gif/sound/TEXT type...
question toughness :
    depends on asset toughness, (how tough screenshot is)
    question title, what exactly was asked .
they should have min and max level , or some funtion with distribution among level

there should be option to force no effect condition for some image .. as some movie screenshot can be manully special effected , like cartoonize, face swap, cartoon logo, 

//asset downloader :
// question have two things, asset and json
// json will be on db/table , eg put it in server side only
// but assets for now ,some, can be put with apk assets...
// for package or so, we can download many images at once, as a zip/asset-bundle .. and put to sdcard..and then read from sdcard
//image/assetbundles will be on firebase storage. Donâ€™t know how to load asset-bundle using firebase sdk.

four option, with mulitp correct may be
two answer  type
option based, or fill in the blanks/
each fill in the blanks can have own lifeline 3-4. you can buy further or get it converted from other resourc/hints..???
but then will have to think how session ends..

??
1. is how session ends
2. how carrier/levelprogress work
3. what carrency conversion wll be , from package/puzzle to carriere



Effect:
replace face with different actor.... extra reward question.. as such asset making  is tough
or put effects only on face.. or remove face with white background.... we can upload image with a binary mask, then shader can take care of rest
unhide blocks.. as effect

unique name (but english word), so that google search can also give your app name as result 
under 11 character
spell well, prononciation, clear, grey/gray not good, 
subtitle
google: in description use the main keywords at least 5-5 times
if possible try to include the keyword in name
google : video is very much important

keyword:
comma seperate, no phrase, no special character, 
No need to put trivial namse always: Better to be in the top 5 results for an average-searched keyword than in the top 100 for a highly-searched keyword
 It doesnâ€™t matter if you rank #542 for a keyword that gets a billion searches a month. Nobody will scroll that far in search results to find you. Look for keywords that you can rank in the top 10 for.
